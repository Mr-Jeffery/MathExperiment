# Math Modeling
This is a repository used to store all the homeworks and lab exercises I did in "Mathematical Experiment" (MA207) taught by Kailiang Wu at SUSTech.
There are mainly three types of files in the repository:
- `.m`: MATLAB scripts
- `.m`: MATLAB live scripts, it stores both the scripts and the results, similar to `jupyter`.
- `.tm`: [TexMacs](www.texmacs.org) files, used to generate PDF and LaTex codes for reports.
